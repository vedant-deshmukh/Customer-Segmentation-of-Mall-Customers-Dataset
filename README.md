# Customer-Segmentation-of-Mall-Customers-Dataset
<h3><b>Customer Segmentation using KMeans Algorithm</b></h3>
<h4> This project aims at classifying the customers of the mall based on some features in order to show them targetd ads, or sell targeted products in order maximize the profit of the mall. This project is built using KMeans Algorithm in Unsupervised Machine Learning.
<br>
This Project includes-
<br> <br>
<ul>
<li> Dataset was cleaned, visualized and analysed using python libraries. The dataset used is Mall_Customers Dataset from Kaggle.com 
<li> The optimum number of clusters were found using Elbow/WCSS method.
<li> The customers were divided into clusters using KMeans Algorithm.
<li> The project completes its objective. Now, the grouped customers can be dealt seperatedly and differently to maximize the sale.
</ul>
